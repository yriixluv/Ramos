      <td>The Steering Committee, led by the school principal, provides overall direction and supervision. Working Committees focus on areas like advocacy and marketing, resource mobilization, program implementation, and administration/finance.</td>
      
      <td>a daily or weekly ritual, particularly common in the Philippines, that involves raising and lowering the Philippine flag, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and often singing the national anthem. </td>
